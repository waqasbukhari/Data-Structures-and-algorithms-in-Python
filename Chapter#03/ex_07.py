"""

(a) Running time of algorithm A is always O(f(n))

Proof:

the statement says that in every case even the worst case, the running
time of the algorithm under discussion is proportionalto the number of
data members used.

Also, Big-Oh notation tells us the worst case running timeof an algorithm
So the worst case running time of this algorithm is O(f(n)) This statement
corresponds to the 2nd clause i.e. (b) In worst case, Running time of 
algorithm A is O(f(n)) which proves that both of these statements are
equivalent

"""
initial empty stack -> length of stack = 0

25 push operations  -> 25 elements added

12 top operations   -> checked what is at the top for 12 times

(1 extreme)10 pop operatons out of which 3 were wasted i.e. no element was popped -> 10-3 = 7 elements eleminated

Final length of stack  = 25 elements added - 7 elements popped
                       = 18 elements
(extreme 2) empty error was raised by top operations
Final length of stack  = 25 elements added - 10 elements popped
                       = 15 elements
So the final length of stack will be between 15 and 18 elements

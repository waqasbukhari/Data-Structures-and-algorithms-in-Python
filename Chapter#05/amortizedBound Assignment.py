"""

we consider the geometrical increase in size of array i.e. increase in array

capacity e.g. twice large as before resizing this maybe much more increase

in the space usage of the array as compared to original number of elements

in array but there will be much more increase in runtime efficiency

because there will be fewer resize events and eventually less time usage.
.
.
.
If there is arithmatic increase in capacity, there will be more and more
resize events and the runtime will increase incredibly.
